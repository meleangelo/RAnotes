# Notes and templates for RAs


## Models

[Notes on network models](models/lecturenotes_networks.pdf): Preliminary version of a set of lecture notes I am writing about networks, network models and estimation of these models. 

[Notes on ERGMs](): 

[hergms]()

[Mele 2022](http://meleangelo.github.io/files/homophily_dec2019_revisionJBES.pdf): paper that describes the economic model that micro-founds the hierarchical ERGMs

## R tutorials

[Introduction to Network Analysis using R](https://yunranchen.github.io/intro-net-r/): Book on networks, with applications in R. Chapters 1-3 are useful

**Data for the tutorials on network analysis** 

1. [florentine families](Rtutorials/firenze.txt): network of marriages among florentine families during renaissance
2. [edgelist](Rtutorials/edgelist.txt): network of people in a epidemiological study
3. [attributes for edgelist](Rtutorials/nodal.attr.txt): individual chracteristics of people in the file edgelist
4. [attributes for edgelist data (only race and sex)](Rtutorials/attr.txt): individual chracteristics of people in the file edgelist (only race and sex)

[Examples of Network analysis with R](Rtutorials/tutorial_igraph.Rmd): Simple introduction to `igraph` package in R, to visualize the network and to perform simple computations of network features, such as degrees, degree distributions, clustering, centrality, etc.

[Intro to ERGM estimation with R](Rtutorials/statnet_intro.Rmd): An introduction to ERGM estimation using `statnet` and `ergm` in R. 

[ERGM estimation of different models with R](Rtutorials/statnet_models.Rmd): An overview of some terms for estimation of ERGMs in `ergm` and `statnet`.

## How-to for HPC
[How to open a RStudio server on Rockfish](howto/OpenRStudioServer.md): This is a short tutorial on how to open a Rstudio server on Rockfish.

[User Guide for ARCH at JHU](https://www.arch.jhu.edu/guide/): The manual for Rockfish at Johns Hopkins. 

[Other resources about ARCH at JHU](https://marcc.readthedocs.io): this was developed for the old MARCC system, but there are useful materials here as well.
